# Introduction to JS: Variables

## Overview
This is the beginning of a series of assignments that will cover core JavaScript concepts. Each part will include a short conceptual lesson and an exercise associated with it. You will see code that may look unfamiliar to you. This is intentional because when it becomes a focused lesson, you will have seen it before and the comments related to it.

In this assignment, we will be covering creating variables in JavaScript. You will use the string data type in the assignment.

## Instructions

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Git:** Version control system to clone and manage the repository.
- **GitHub:** make sure you have an account to sync your repositories to.

### Cloning the Repository

Follow these steps to fork and clone the repository:

1. Open your terminal or Git Bash.
2. Navigate to the directory where you want to store the project.
3. Fork the repository.
4. Clone the forked repository to edit on your local computer.

### Viewing the Project

To view the project locally, you can either open the project files in your code editor or open the HTML files in your browser.

### Tasks

#### Part 1.

- [ ] View the site with Live Preview.
- [ ] Read the concept content served from `index.html`.
- [ ] Do the experiment section inside `index.js`.
- [ ] When finished with experimenting, comment out everything in `index.js`. You can use these as references for future project/assignments.

#### Part 2

- [ ] Navigate to the Assignment Page
- [ ] Read the assignment overview
- [ ] In `assignment.js`:
    - [ ] Create a variable named `book` that cannot be reassigned. Set the value to your favorite book.
    - [ ] Create a variable named `activity` that can be reassigned. Set the value to your favorite activity.
