# Introduction to JS: Variables

## Overview
This is the beginning of a series of assignments that will cover core JavaScript concepts. Each part will include a short conceptual lesson and an exercise associated with it. You will see code that may look unfamiliar to you. This is intentional because when it becomes a focused lesson, you will have seen it before and the comments related to it.

In this assignment, we will cover creating variables in JavaScript. You will use the string data type in the assignment. More on data types in the next assignment.
